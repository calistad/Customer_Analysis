## Finding

The top five most significant features for customer enrollment are `VerifyPhone`, `remain_screen_list`, `VerifyDateOfBirth`, `numscreens`, and `location`.

Two models would be recommended with the best performance.

#### Extreme Gradient Booster
* Highest Accuracy
* Highest Roc-Auc score
* Highest Precision - 'Yes'
* Highest Recall - 'No'
* Greatest performance on Lift Curve

#### Logistic Regression
* Most accurate predictions on testing dataset
* Highest Precision - 'No'
* Highest Recall - 'Yes'
