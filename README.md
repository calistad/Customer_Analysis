# Customer Analysis

## Overview

Help a company to optimize sales while better understand the customers by conducting 4 data analysis.

* Classify 50,000 customers based on their behaviors to enhance subscriptions and eliminate budget.

* Combine products that would be likely purchased together by performing a Market Basket Analysis among 522,000+ transactions.

* Implement the Collaborative Filtering Recommender by analyzing 4300+ customers' purchases to suggest similar items.

* Improve customer satisfaction using NLP and Deep Learning models with 74% accuracy.

## 1. Customer Classification

[Click here for a detailed version](https://github.com/calistad/Customer_Analysis/blob/main/Customer_subscription.md)

The company launches a mobile app with the free version and the paid upgrade version. The company provided the upgrade version in the free version app for 24 hours to collect the customerâ€™s behavior. 

The main goal is to sell the premium version app at a low advertisement cost to eliminate budget while enhancing subscriptions.

#### Early Stopping

Early Stopping Criteria were used to avoid the model from overfitting. 

The maximum epochs of this model are 40, but it stopped training at 26 epochs since metrics were not improved anymore. 

![Screen Shot 2022-07-17 at 3 25 01 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88747464/179422365-dc63a1c6-7264-4bb6-ba3b-46389461d343.png)

Overall, the **Functional API** Model achieves a better performance, which should be used for future analysis.

* Dense hidden layers: **Rectified Linear Activation (ReLu) Function** (Results in higher accuracy than Sigmoid Function.)
* Dense output layer: **SoftMax Function**
* Loss Function: **Categorical Cross-entropy** (Results in higher accuracy than Binary Cross-entropy.)
* Optimizer: **Adam** (Handles noise and reduces overfitting to improve the model performance.)
