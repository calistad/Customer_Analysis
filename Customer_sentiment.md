# Customer Reviews Analysis

## Overview

To analyze customers' previous reviews from Amazon and then predict future consumers' sentiments.

### Purpose
Is it possible to analyze customer sentiment using **Neural Network** and **Natural Language Processing** techniques, so the company can provide appropriate actions to improve customer satisfaction?

## Results

**Deep Learning Neural Network** is capable to perform a text classification with high accuracy and lower-level computation. 

**Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** are used for sentiment analysis, which would learn the writers' emotions by analyzing texts.

### Original Reviews vs. Cleaned Reviews

* Vocabulary Size: 1568
* Word Embedding Length: 6
* Max Sequence Length: 113

| | Accuracy | Loss |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Training | 97% | 0.12 |
| Validation | 79% | 0.42 |
| Testing | 74% | 0.56 |

* **ROC-AUC** score is 0.82.

### Early Stopping

Early Stopping Criteria were used to avoid the model from overfitting. The model might stop training once the accuracy does not increase.

The maximum epochs of this model are 40, but it stopped training at 26 epochs since metrics were not improved anymore.

Instead of spending time looking over the list and trying to find the best epoch, I would know the final training epoch contains the best
result. However, if the model trains for lesser epochs with a lower number of patience, this can result in a low accuracy score.

## Summary

Overall, the **Functional API** Model achieves a better performance, which should be used for future analysis.

* Dense hidden layers: **Rectified Linear Activation (ReLu) Function** (Results in higher accuracy than Sigmoid Function.)
* Dense output layer: **SoftMax Function**
* Loss Function: **Categorical Cross-entropy** (Results in higher accuracy than Binary Cross-entropy.)
* Optimizer: **Adam** (Handles noise and reduces overfitting to improve the model performance.)

If the company wants to predict future consumer sentiment, they are recommended to use **Natural Language Processing** and **Neural Networks**. 

They may further use another model for cross-validation to achieve high accuracy results.
